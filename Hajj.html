			<div style="font-size:30px;"> "And Hajj (pilgrimage to Makkah) to the House (Ka'bah) is a duty that mankind owes to Allah, for those who can afford the expenses (for one's transportation, provision and residence)."(Quran 3:97)		
		</div></b></i></p>
		<p style="font-size:25px;">	
			Hajj literally means, "to continuously strive to reach one's goal." The Hajj, or Pilgrimage to Mecca, is a once in a lifetime obligation for those who have the physical and financial ability to undertake the journey.
		</p>
		<p style="font-size:25px;">	
			Pilgrimage to the Holy city of Makkah (in Saudi Arabia) and other sacred sites must be performed at least once in a person's life, if they are physically and financially capable.
		</p>
		<p style="font-size:25px;">	
			Performing the pilgrimage is a temporary suspension of all worldly activities, and is a time for one to reflect, worship, seek the forgiveness of Allah and attain His closeness.
		</p>
		<p style="font-size:25px;">	
			The Pilgrimage is an annual event in the 12th month of the lunar calendar (Dhul-Hijjah in Arabic), which unifies people of every colour, race, status and age, as they join in worship of the One True God. All pilgrims wear simple and similar clothing, which strips away distinctions of class and culture, so that all stand equal before Allah.
		</p>
		<p style="font-size:25px;">	
			Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) said, <b>"Whoever performs Hajj and does not utter obscenities or commit sin, will come back just like the day when his mother bore him (i.e. pure of sins)."</b>
		</p>
		<p style="font-size:25px;">	
			Hajj involves following in the footsteps of Prophet Abraham, as taught to us by Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon them). This great act of worship consists of many components including sacrificing an animal, supplicating, visiting and praying at various sites, circling the Ka'bah, walking between two mountains, as well as many other rituals, all of which are performed over a period of 6 continuous days.
		</p>
		<p style="font-size:25px;">	
			Such an experience is life-altering and humbles a person, making them more patient and thankful to Allah. Brotherhood is increased, as is the sense that all Muslims, regardless of their differences, are one nation.
		</p>
		<p style="font-size:25px;">	
			The Hajj is essentially a re-enactment of the rituals of the great prophets and teachers of faith. Pilgrims symbolically relive the experience of exile and atonement undergone by Adam and Eve after they were expelled from Heaven, wandered the earth, met again and sought forgiveness in the valley of Mecca. They also retrace the frantic footsteps of the wife of Abraham, Hagar, as she ran between the hills of Safa and Marwa searching for water for her thirsty baby (which according to Muslim tradition, God answered with the well of Zam Zam). Lastly, the pilgrims also commemorate the willingness of Abraham to sacrifice his son for the sake of God. God later substituted a ram in place of his son.

			<div style="font-size:25px;">Performing the rituals of Hajj provides a reminder of how the great prophets and teachers of faith established a deep and personal relationship with God. As the pilgrim makes his supplications to God, he realizes that He is asking of the same God that answered the prayers of those before him. These reminders are an important part of strengthening one's faith, trust and dependence in God.

			The faithful hope that the Hajj will bring about a deep spiritual transformation, one that will make him or her a better person. If such a change from within does not occur, then the Hajj was merely a physical and material exercise devoid of any spiritual significance. As all great religions teach, we are more than mere physical creatures in that we possess an essence beyond the material world. Indeed, this is why all great religions have a tradition of pilgrimage. In the Islamic tradition, Hajj encapsulates this spiritual journey toward this essence. Hajj teaches one to show sincerity and humilty in one's relationship with God. The result of a successful Hajj is a rich inner peace, which is manifested outwardly in the values of justice, honesty, respect, generosity, kindness, forgiveness, mercy and empathy.

It would probably make sense to only those who understand that the joy of giving that touches others' lives is far greater and deeper than the joy of receiving." Dr. Mohammad Omar Farooq
